The idea of sexfriend still facinates me. Having a sexfriend is cool, as  long as you and your partner is only messing with 1 or 2 partners at a  time. Having multiple partners are dangerous, to be honest.

This  kind of relationship is convenient as well. You don't need to invest a  lot of time in your partner, and just meet with them when you just want  to have some skinships or sex. Few things to invest, few things to lose.

I guess there are a lot of people that don't really want to commit with someone, but still want to have a fulfilling sex life.

For me, I don't really get it when someone enter a relationship without  marriage in sight. Isn't it just a waste of time? Waste of effort? Man,  if I want to settle, I'll just enter a relationship and make it clear to  my partner that I'm already considering her as a marriage partner. If  you don't see me on the same light, then I guess let's just settle being  a sexfriend or friends, and don't waste both of our time.

Just  don't be a whore or a manwhore when entering a sexfriend relationship.  Having 2 partners, then changing partners every month seems like a  different thing than that sexfriend thing.

Last thing, if you are  entering this kind of relationship, just make sure to make some rules  and stick to it. Someone break a rule? Break the relationship. It's  pretty convenient setup, but it has also some risk. And don't put some  romantic feelings on it as well. You're putting yourself to a lot of  headache.
