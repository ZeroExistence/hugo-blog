Stock market is always fascinating. When you  think that you are playing with the market, it is always the other way  around. Market usually play with you, and when that happens, your  portfolio bleeds.

As for me, I am risk-taker, and plunge into the  market. I always believe that experience is the best teacher. This is  the case with the stock market, with a cost. Every move you do on market  cost money, and if you’re not careful, you will dive into loss spree.  It might be alright for someone who is risk-tolerant, but what about  beginners? That’s where Investragrams Trading Cup come to play.
