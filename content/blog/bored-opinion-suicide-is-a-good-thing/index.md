Suicide is such a cool thing. Isn't it the last biggest decision that you can make when you’re still alive. Why would other prevents suicide, if the one who decided it is themselves?

I  also like to point out that suicide is pretty much like abortion? Isn't  abortion worse than suicide? Atleast in suicide, you consent to die.  You decided it. Do you consent when you are still a fetus, and your  parents decided to abort you? Well, you didn’t consent to be born as  well, so that’s kind of funny.

I also like the idea that you  decide on suicide on selfish manner. You can only decide on it when you  removed the other external factors like family and friends. I don't care  why you commit suicide, but it's cool.

What if someone asked me  for advice that they want to end it all? I'll probably say "why not?".  If someone I know commit suicide, I'll say "man, that’s cool and dope".

Personally,  suicide might be the end of me. Or maybe not. It's too boring to kill  myself, and I prefer to play the game of life a little bit longer. You  are already suffering enough, so you should learn how to enjoy suffering.
