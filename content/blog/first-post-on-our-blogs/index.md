Hello everyone, this is moe.ph and I would like to welcome you to our simple blog sites. I’m already planning to launch some kind of blog site in the past to help me practice my writing skills and to share some knowledge that I learned in everyday life.

I have launch three sites for our blogs, the blog.moe.ph, the tech.moe.ph, and the finance.moe.ph. I launched different blog sites, so that I can separate each of our posts to appropriate sites. I don’t want to post some shitposting with some technical posts.

For blog.moe.ph, I might tend to post some of my thoughts here and maybe some business and Facebook related stuff.

For tech.moe.ph, I would compile most of my computing related stuffs there like on how I setup this blog sites and my environment on running my systems

On finance.moe.ph, I would probably post most stocks-related stuff there and some pointers in making money. I’m still not sure if finance would be the best term for that blog site, but I guess whatever works!

Since I’m on a freelance mode right now, I might be able to post frequently on these blogs, so I hope that you would pick something out of these blogs.

I guess that’s all for now, and keep being cute and depressed.
